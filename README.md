# JavaScript Digital clock

It's pretty simple to make a digigital clock in JavaScript.  Once you learn about teh date object and setInterval, you're home free.

## Suggestions for making it your own:
```
* Show times for more than one time zone. (Defaults to user's time zone right now.)
* Add AM/PM (make it 12-hour clock instead of 24-hour ....or better yet, make a button to flip display).
* alarm clock?
* add the date (day, month, year).
* style it (make it beautiful)
* use geolocation to pull in more information
* analog Clock
* monospace font
* tie this into the debt clock API.
